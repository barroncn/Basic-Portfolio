			<p id="aboutme"> 
				I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte with a degree in Mathematics, a minor in Chemistry, and a concentration in Actuarial Science. As I trudged through an internship with a life insurance company, I realized I was on the wrong career path. I want to utilize my creativity and problem solving skills. I want a career that is challenging and dynamic. After talking to a few different people and doing lots of research, I decided to learn how to code!
				<br>
				When I'm not practicing coding, you can find me outside. I love hiking, paddling, and travelling to new places!
