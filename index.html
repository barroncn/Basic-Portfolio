				<h2>About Me</h2>
				I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte with a degree in Mathematics, 
  	           a minor in Chemistry, and a concentration in Actuarial Science. As I 
   	           trudged through an internship with a life insurance company, I realized 
            	I was on the wrong career path. I want to utilize my 	creativity and 
	           problem solving skills. I want a career that is challenging and dynamic. 
              After talking to a few different people and doing lots of research, I decided 
              to learn how to code!
