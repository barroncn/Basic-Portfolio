		<h2>About Me</h2>	
		<p>
			I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte with a degree in Mathematics, 
            a minor in Chemistry, and a concentration in Actuarial Science. As I 
            trudged through an internship with a life insurance company, I realized 
            I was on the wrong career path. I want to utilize my creativity and 
            problem solving skills. I want a career that is challenging and dynamic. 
            After talking to a few different people and doing lots of research, I decided 
            to learn how to code!
